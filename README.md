# CoIoTe Project

CoIoTe is a new service being developed by TIM/Telecom Italia which is
capable of connecting Internet of Things (IoT) objects to Internet by creating
on-the-fly mobile hotspots with the help of TIM smartphone users. The goal
of the project was to optimize a system capable of assigning missions to
mobile users with a trade-off between: level of connectivity and cost of
engaging users.
